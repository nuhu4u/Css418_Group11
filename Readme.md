## School Fee Payment System

This project implements a web-based school fee payment system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The system allows students to confirm their payment with a matriculation number and provides options based on the validation result.

### Features

- **Confirmation Page**: Users can enter their matriculation number to confirm payment.
- **Validation**: Validates the matriculation number against a predefined value.
- **Success Actions**: Upon successful validation, users can register for courses or return to the homepage.

### Prerequisites

- Web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- MySQL database server
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP

### Getting Started

To use this system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-fee-payment.git
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   - Create a new database named `group7` in MySQL.
   - Import the database schema from `database.sql` to set up the required tables.

3. **Configuration**
   - Open `config.php` and update the database connection settings (`$host`, `$username`, `$password`, `$database`) with your MySQL credentials.

4. **Deployment**
   - Copy the project files to your web server's document root directory (e.g., `/var/www/html`).
   - Ensure that PHP is properly configured on your web server.

5. **Accessing the System**
   - Navigate to `http://yourdomain.com/confirm_payment.html` to access the payment confirmation page.

### Usage

1. **Confirm Payment**
   - Enter a valid matriculation number in the input field.
   - Click the **Submit** button.

2. **Validation**
   - If the matriculation number is valid (`'2021/2/2354cs'` in this example), a success message will be displayed.
   - Choose to register for courses by clicking the **Register Course** button or return to the homepage using the **Go to Home** button.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that your database credentials (`$username` and `$password`) are kept secure and not exposed in public repositories.
- Implement SSL/TLS (HTTPS) for secure communication between clients and the server.
- Sanitize user inputs and use parameterized queries in PHP to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Regularly update your server software and dependencies to protect against known vulnerabilities.
